# Inventory-managenent-system
This is a code of inventory mangement system which we  had crated a code for creating a dictionary for a batch of product and then creating the code for buying the product and upadating the inventory
In this file First I had created a inentory where the details of all the product will be stored.It is coded in such a way that when you run the code at it will create a dictionary for you.(which is the CRICKET_BAT.json file)
Next is when your dictionary gets converted into string and the gets stored in the CRICKET_BAT.json file.
# IS for buying the items from the inventory...
Thus then again using the json file. converting the string format into dictionary format.
Then we are running the code to show details of all the item we hve with us.
Thus the user selects from it.
Fill the corect entries...
All the billing amount gets updated in sales.json file for each transcation.
at last their is a code to update the changes in the Qunatity of the product......
